## Overview of the System

This system automates invoice reconciliation workflows by leveraging an advanced multi-agent architecture to process supplier invoices, match them against purchase orders, detect discrepancies, and make intelligent approval decisions. The system handles real-world document complexity including scanned PDFs, varied formats, and incomplete data.

### Problem Statement

Manual invoice reconciliation in enterprise environments is:
- **Time-intensive**: Requires significant human resources for document review
- **Error-prone**: Subject to human oversight and inconsistent application of rules
- **Non-scalable**: Processing time increases linearly with invoice volume
- **Risk-exposed**: Vulnerable to fraud, duplicate payments, and compliance violations

### Solution

This multi-agent system automates 80-90% of invoice reconciliation workflows while maintaining human oversight for high-risk cases through intelligent escalation mechanisms.

The system also includes a professional review dashboard that mirrors real enterprise workflows by separating automatically approved invoices from those requiring human intervention, complete with PDF previews, agent reasoning traces, and AI-generated explanations for escalations.

## Key Features 

- **Intelligent Document Processing**  
  OCR-based extraction combined with LLM-powered structuring to handle scanned PDFs, rotated documents, and heterogeneous invoice templates.

- **True Multi-Agent Orchestration**  
  LangGraph-based agent coordination with explicit state handoffs, conditional routing, and non-linear execution paths.

- **Robust PO Matching Engine**  
  Hybrid matching strategy using direct PO references, fuzzy string matching, and confidence scoring to handle incomplete or missing identifiers.

- **Discrepancy Detection & Risk Classification**  
  Automated detection of price mismatches, quantity discrepancies, missing items, and missing PO references with severity-aware classification.

- **Confidence-Based Decision Making**  
  Automated routing into:
  - AUTO_APPROVE  
  - REQUEST_CLARIFICATION  
  - ESCALATE_TO_HUMAN  
  based on discrepancy severity and match confidence.

- **Human-in-the-Loop Workflow**  
  High-risk or low-confidence invoices are escalated to human review with full context, supporting safe financial decision-making.

- **LLM-Generated Human Review Explanation**  
  For invoices requiring manual review, the system generates a concise natural-language explanation describing *why* human intervention is required.

- **Real-Time Agent Reasoning Transparency**  
  Live, step-by-step streaming of each agent’s internal reasoning, displayed as a chat-style activity feed with agent-specific color coding.

- **Interactive Review Dashboard**  
  Streamlit-based UI featuring:
  - Multi-invoice batch upload
  - Auto-Approved vs Human Review tabs
  - Side-by-side PDF preview and reasoning trace
  - Structured outputs and audit-friendly explanations

- **Fault-Tolerant Design**  
  Graceful handling of OCR failures, LLM parsing errors, missing data, and ambiguous matches without system crashes.

### Decision Outcomes of the System

- **AUTO_APPROVE**: Clean matches with no material discrepancies
- **REQUEST_CLARIFICATION**: Minor issues requiring supplier follow-up
- **ESCALATE_TO_HUMAN**: Critical discrepancies requiring manual review

### Review & Decision Layer

This system includes a review layer that categorizes invoices into operational queues, which are listed below:

- **Auto-Approved Queue**  
  Invoices with high-confidence matches and no material discrepancies.

- **Human Review Queue**  
  Invoices with critical discrepancies, missing PO references, or low confidence scores.

Invoices routed to human review are accompanied by:
- Original PDF preview available
- Full agent reasoning trace
- AI-generated explanation summarizing the escalation rationale

### Agent Responsibilities

#### 1. Document Intelligence Agent
Extracts and structures invoice data from PDFs:
- Performs OCR on scanned and digital documents
- Leverages LLM for intelligent data extraction
- Produces structured JSON output with confidence scores

#### 2. Matching Agent
Identifies corresponding purchase orders:
- Direct PO number matching when available
- Fuzzy item-based matching for missing PO numbers
- Confidence scoring for match quality assessment

#### 3. Discrepancy Detection Agent
Validates invoice accuracy against PO data:
- Line-item price comparison
- Quantity verification
- Item presence validation
- Supports configurable tolerance thresholds

#### 4. Resolution Recommendation Agent
Applies business rules for decision making:
- Confidence-weighted risk assessment
- Multi-factor decision criteria
- Escalation path determination

#### 5. Human Review Agent
Provides human-in-the-loop oversight:
- Reviews high-risk escalations
- Overrides automated decisions when appropriate
- Generates actionable feedback for process improvement

## Test Coverage

The system has been validated against diverse invoice scenarios:

| Test Case | Description | Expected Outcome | Status |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|--------|
| Clean Invoice | Standard format, perfect match | AUTO_APPROVE | ✅ Pass |
| Scanned Document | Low-quality scan, rotated image | AUTO_APPROVE | ✅ Pass |
| Alternate Format | Non-standard template layout | AUTO_APPROVE | ✅ Pass |
| Price Discrepancy | Material unit price mismatch | ESCALATE_TO_HUMAN | ✅ Pass |
| Missing PO Reference | No PO number provided | ESCALATE_TO_HUMAN | ✅ Pass |
| Quantity Mismatch | Incorrect quantities ordered | REQUEST_CLARIFICATION | ✅ Pass |

### Reasoning Transparency & Explainability

Every agent contributes real-time reasoning to a shared execution state.  
These reasoning steps are streamed live to the UI and displayed as a chat-style activity feed, enabling:

- Clear visibility into agent handoffs
- Step-by-step decision justification
- Debugging and audit readiness

For invoices escalated to human review, an additional LLM-generated explanation provides a concise, business-friendly summary of why manual intervention is required.

## Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations

- **OCR Accuracy**: Performance degrades with poor scan quality or complex layouts
- **LLM Extraction**: Occasional structured output failures require fallback logic
- **Matching Heuristics**: Rule-based approach may miss nuanced relationships
- **Synchronous Processing**: Single-threaded execution limits throughput

### Production Roadmap

**Near-term Enhancements:**
- Integrate layout-aware OCR (Azure Form Recognizer, Google Document AI)
- Implement embedding-based semantic matching for improved accuracy
- Add asynchronous processing with job queues (Celery, Redis)
- Deploy comprehensive monitoring and alerting infrastructure

**Long-term Vision:**
- Machine learning model training from human feedback loop
- Multi-modal document understanding (tables, charts, signatures)
- Real-time drift detection and model retraining
- Integration with enterprise ERP systems (SAP, Oracle, NetSuite)
